// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

Take input of two numbers and add them together to find the sum.

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Take an input of a number and if that number is divisible by 2, then it is an even number.
If not, then it is an odd number

// Exercise 3:
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a) Take 5 inputs separately
b) Take the 5, separate inputs, add them into a sum, and take the sum and divide it by 5 to obtain the average
c) Read the 5 inputs and find the smallest number by going through each number and replace the smallest number if the current number
is greater than the next number. Do this until all numbers have been vetted through.
Repeat this process, but instead of the smallest number, find the largest.
d) Once the average is found, write out the message "The average of (insert each input here) is (insert the average)"
Once the smallest and largest numbers are found, write out the message "Out of the numbers (insert numbers here) the smallest number
is (insert smallest number) and the largest number is  (insert largest number)"
